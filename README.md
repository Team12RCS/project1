The Project is an Insurance Application where the user can access a database with Insurances' information and get answers concerning the Status of an Insurance (Updated/Expired), the Incurances that are about to expire within a given amount of days and also the fine that a vehicle(s) owner has to pay. Lastly, sorting according to the plates' number can be performed.
